TODO

This document will be numbered in order of additions to the TODO file,
however the order in which they appear will be roughly the order in
which I plan to do them.

4) Reevaluate/bugfix the "vanish culling" code

5) Fix the portal stencil code!!!

8) Triangulate collision geometry upon loading!

7) Rewrite collision code:
introduce new collision primitives:
Spaces should have an array of planar normals of its collision surfaces.
Each planar normal should then list the values for 'd' to complete the
parametric equation of each such plane. Then each of those should list
the polygons in that plane which are collidable.

The collision test can go like this:
For each planar normal 'n':
  project entity movement along the line r*n
  For each 'd':
    if movement does not pass through the value 'd', next 'd'
    For each polygon in this plane:
      use ray casting (even/odd) rule to determine collision

9) In Escher map loader, underdelivery of the final record type provided
   of spaces (usually "face") goes unnoticed. The map loader should bail
   if this happens.
