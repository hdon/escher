TODO

4) Reevaluate/bugfix the "vanish culling" code

5) Fix the portal stencil code!!!

6) Fix buggy line segment collision code

7) Rewrite collision code:
introduce new collision primitives:
Spaces should have an array of planar normals of its collision surfaces.
Each planar normal should then list the values for 'd' to complete the
parametric equation of each such plane. Then each of those should list
the polygons in that plane which are collidable.

The collision test can go like this:
For each planar normal 'n':
  project entity movement along the line r*n
  For each 'd':
    if movement does not pass through the value 'd', next 'd'
    For each polygon in this plane:
      use ray casting (even/odd) rule to determine collision
